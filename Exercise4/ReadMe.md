## Exercise 4 - friendRoutes.js (Page 44):

Use the Express App template in Exercise4/m5lab4_expressapp from Google Drive. The friendRoutes.js file details 4 tasks to give more understanding on setting up different types of requests via routes:

- Part 1: Add support to the 'filter' endpoint for a new query parameter 'letter' which filters friends by starting letter
- Part 2: Modify the 'info' route to only return the user-agent, content-type and accept header data
- Part 3: Modify the dynamic GET route to return a single friend object matching the dynamic 'id' request parameter
- Part 4: Complete the PUT route which will update data for an existing friend
  Test each of the above with different data, and include some basic data validation.
